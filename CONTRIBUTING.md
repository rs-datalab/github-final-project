## Before You Start
1. **Search issues/PRs** to avoid duplicates.
2. **Open an issue** to discuss non-trivial changes.
3. Keep changes **small and focused**.

---

## Local Development Setup

**Requirements**
- POSIX-compatible shell (Linux/macOS/WSL)
- `bash`

**Run**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/github-final-project.git
cd github-final-project
